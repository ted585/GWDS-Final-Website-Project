      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Alignment</b></p>
        <p>By having text too symetrical and 'grid like' you can run the risk of having a boring looking poster thats not particularly exiting. So I decided to try and make the poster look more interesting by adding the 
            much larger lettering to the right hand side. By aligning these letters also, I believe it added to the effectiveness of the poster while sticking to the theme. As well 
        as this, the half black outline is supposed to give the poster a 3D effect and 'pop' out of the page. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-third w3-container w3-margin-bottom">
      <img src="tf-contrast.png" alt="Norway" style="width:100%" >
      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Contrast</b></p>
        <p>When trying to decide what to do when designing a poster that demonstrated contrast I noticed that the logo of the true fale film festival contained a good degree of it already.
            As a result, I thought I'd really make it the focus of this poster by putting it front and centre. In addition, making the whole page replicate the logos' style with the 'penned on' border similar to 
            the outline of the logo itsself, I feel represents the festival effectively.
            Maintaining the predetermined colour shceme already gave a good level of contrast the addition of the pause and play signs show a different type. Not contrast in colour but 
            in meaning also. 
        </p>

    <div class="w3-third w3-container">
      <img src="tf-proximity.png" alt="Norway" style="width:100%" >
      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Proximity</b></p>
        <p>With not a whole load of similar pieces of information to group together I realised that I'd have to think of another way to make the poster look exiting and not too sparse.
            I decided to use the existing logo to take up the whole background and add faint colour and patterning to the mix. Although, in doing so it became apparent that the design
            clearly has a large crossover to the repition poster and could possibly fit that brief as well. 
        </p>

          <div class="w3-container w3-white">
            <p><b>Repetition</b></p>
            <p>Following the close call with the proximity poster I thought I'd need to really amp up the amount of repition in this poster. As a result, I added the stripe of mini logos to give
                the poster something other than just horizontal lines of text across a grey background. When reading the brief I wanted to really use the logo and as much of a 'theme' from it as 
                possible in order for the posters to still remain true to the branding of the True/False festival. This is why in all the posters that i made the logo is displayed clearly along with 
                the name of the event.

      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Axial</b></p>
        <p>With this design the hierachy of information felt particularly important and using an axial style felt appropriate to show this off. As a result I put the artist's name large and in the
            centre to capture the attention of the reader. Then the following subsidiary information followed in increasingly smaller text around the centre axis.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-third w3-container w3-margin-bottom">
      <img src="bilateral.png" alt="Norway" style="width:100%" >
      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Bilateral</b></p>
        <p>This technique demonstration was insprired by one of the works from a previous exhibition that the artist set up, named <a href="https://www.1stdibs.com/art/photography/color-photography/rinko-kawauchi-untitled-from-illuminance-rinko-kawauchi-beam-light-hill-abstract/id-a_10748572/"> 'Illuminance'.</a>
        getting the 3D effect and using the beam of light to seperate the page, I feel, is an elegant way of showing the bilateral technique.   </p>

      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Dialatational</b></p>
        <p>I wanted the artist's name front and center again with this one and I think that the dialatational typeface is good for amplifying that. However, I believe it can quickly get too 
            busy when too much text is added so i thought to keep the design interesting, i'd use a generative feature thats built into Adobe Illustrator to create the zigzag pattern behind the text.

      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Modular</b></p>
        <p>With the grid technique I decided to keep the design really simple to replicate the minimalism often seen in modern and contempoary art. evon some of Kawauchi's works are very minimalistic
            with pieces like <a href= https://awarewomenartists.com/en/artiste/rinko-kawauchi/ >this</a> using imagery thats relatively empty but still effective. </p>

        <p><b>Grid</b></p>
        <p>Alot of Kawauchi's photography contains flowers of different kinds. This presented a good opportunity to reference these works with my own flower design made on Illustrator.
            Repeating these designs to go with the text boxes helps fit the modular typographical technique.

      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Radial</b></p>
        <p>The radial technique also presented an oppertunity to pay homage to the artist's work. this artboard is inspired by this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/12/the-big-picture-a-brilliant-spark-amid-the-darkness">firework </a> that Kawauchi took back in 2001.
            however my version has the added 'streaks' to accomodate the text.

      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Random</b></p>
        <p>I wanted to achive an effective design without the page looking too messy so i decided to contain the 'chaos' within the stream of the water. To maintain some degree of hierachy 
            within the text i made the more important information black and bold with the rest of the text making up the water flow in a random array.
        </p>

      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p><b>Transitional</b></p>
        <p>inspired by a spoon <a href="https://www.libreriapynchon.com/es/libros/utatane-vol-1_ARC0013855">photograph</a> that Kawauchi took in 2010, i saw a nice oppertunity (like with the radial artboard) to referance Kawauchis work with my design. Using colour and 
        the direction of the falling letters to give it hierachy and a flow.</p>
